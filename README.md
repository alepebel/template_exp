This is a general psychophysical experiment where you can present visual and auditory stimulation with high temporal precision. The experiment also includes a QUEST procedure to adaptively adjust the stimuli contrast. The task at this point is non-sensical but it is very easy to modify the code to adjust to new functionalities.
